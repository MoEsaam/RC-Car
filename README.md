## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and build an RC car using an Atmega32 microcontroller, H-bridge motor driver, servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, and Bluetooth module. The project aims to practical application using embedded systems and microcontrollers in creating a smart device.

The car is controlled by a smartphone through Bluetooth and can move in all four directions (right, left, forward, and backward). The user can switch between remote controlling and line-following modes.

To ensure safety and avoid collisions, the car can avoid obstacles using the ultrasonic sensor mounted on the servo motor. The ultrasonic sensor will detect obstacles in the car's path and instruct the car to turn or change direction to avoid hitting it.

### Block Diagram Description
The project makes use of an ATmega32 microcontroller to control various components of the RC car. The microcontroller is connected to an H-bridge, which in turn is connected to the DC motors that provide the car's movement. Additionally, the microcontroller is connected to a Bluetooth module that receives commands through UART and is connected to the remote controller.

A servo motor is also used in the project, which is attached to an ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor is mounted on the servo motor, allowing it to look in different directions. Additionally, an infrared sensor is incorporated into the design.

## Schematic Diagram (Circuit Diagram)

The calculation used to configure the sensor:
Sound velocity = 340.00 m/s = 34000 cm/s
the distance of Object (in cm) = (340000âˆ—Time)/2 = 17000 * Time
Total distance is divided by 2 because the signal travels from HC-SR04 to the object and returns to the module.
Now, here we have selected an internal 16MHz oscillator frequency for ATmega32, with Pre scaler F_CPU/8 for timer frequency.
distance (cm) = 17000 x (TIMER value) x 5 x 10^-7 cm
= 0.0085 x (TIMER value) cm
= (TIMER value) / 117 cm
